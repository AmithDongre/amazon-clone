## How to Use / Explore

- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the static pages.
- Inspect the HTML to understand semantic structure (header, nav, main, footer, etc.).
- Inspect CSS to learn layout patterns (flexbox/grid, spacing, responsive rules).
- Replace sample product images and text with your own to experiment.
---

## Customization Ideas

- Add responsive breakpoints to improve mobile layout.
- Introduce CSS variables to centralize colors and spacing.
- Improve accessibility (semantic ARIA attributes, keyboard focus styles, alt text).
- Add interactivity later using JavaScript (cart, product filters, modal).
