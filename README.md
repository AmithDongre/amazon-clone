# Amazon Clone

A beginner-friendly clone of the Amazon website built using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript). This project focuses on layout, structure, and styling to recreate common e-commerce UI patterns for learning and demonstration purposes.

- Repository: AmithDongre/amazon-clone
- Description: A repo for Amazon Clone. I have developed a beginner friendly clone of Amazon website using HTML and CSS (no JS)
- Languages: HTML (65.1%), CSS (34.9%)

## Demo

To view the site locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/AmithDongre/amazon-clone.git
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
   - On most systems you can double-click the file or open it from your browser (File → Open File).
   - Or from the command line:
     - macOS / Linux: `open index.html` (or `xdg-open index.html`)
     - Windows: `start index.html`

(If you host the project on GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider, include the live demo URL here.)

## Features

- Layout and styling similar to an e-commerce storefront (header, product grid, product cards, footer)
- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- CSS for layout, grid/flexbox usage, and responsive-like breaks (if included)
- No JavaScript — intended for learning HTML/CSS fundamentals

## Built With

- HTML — 65.1%
- CSS — 34.9%

These percentages reflect the repository composition and emphasize the project's focus on markup and styling.

## Files & Structure (example)
A typical structure for this project may look like:

- index.html
- /css
  - styles.css
- /assets
  - images/
- README.md
- ABOUT.md

(Adjust to match your repository actual structure.)

## How to Use / Explore

- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the static pages.
- Inspect the HTML to understand semantic structure (header, nav, main, footer, etc.).
- Inspect CSS to learn layout patterns (flexbox/grid, spacing, responsive rules).
- Replace sample product images and text with your own to experiment.

## Customization Ideas

- Add responsive breakpoints to improve mobile layout.
- Introduce CSS variables to centralize colors and spacing.
- Improve accessibility (semantic ARIA attributes, keyboard focus styles, alt text).
- Add interactivity later using JavaScript (cart, product filters, modal).
